  <h1>Fibonacci sequence art</h1>
    <p>Made by Mai Sakurai and Brandon Leung-Roadman</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is the art that we made so far.</p>
    <div class="column">
    (insert our project)
    </div>
    <p>This is what we were going off of.</p>
    <div class="column">
    <img src="fibonacci art sequence.png" alt="Fibonacci Art Sequence" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    
    <p>We didn't copy it exactly since the Fibonacci sequence doesn't depend on where the squares are placed, just the math.</p>
