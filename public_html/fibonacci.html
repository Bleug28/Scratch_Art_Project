  <h1>Fibonacci sequence art</h1>
    <p>Made by Mai Sakurai and Brandon Leung-Roadman</p>

    <p>This is the art that we made so far.</p>
    <div class="column">
    (insert our project)
    </div>
    <p>This is what we were going off of.</p>
    <div class="column">

         <p>This is the Fibonacci Spiral, made by Leonardo Fibonacci in 1202.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We didn't copy it exactly since the Fibonacci sequence doesn't depend on where the squares are placed, just the math.</p>
<br>
<p>We chose this piece of art because we thought it looked cool and it is a very important thing in math and is quite famous.</p>
<p>Although we didn't expect it to be so hard to make the spiral, there was quite a lot of math and brain power involved in making this.</p>
<br>
<p>Some geometric sequneces in this is the Fibonacci Sequence, which is where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Basically 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=4 and so on forever.</p>
<p>Some things we used to code this was the list function, we used this to do the sequence and replace each number that goes into the list. You should be able to see this happening in the top left of our program.</p>
<p>We then used the list to draw the squares and sort of loop the sequnce to do it on its own. It took a lot of code and time to make this. Unfortunately in the time that we were given we weren't able to make the spiral.</p>
